<h3>FORKED BY: DIYA JAISWAL</h3>

Hello, Diya here! I am a second year student from EnTC branch. I love being creative and try to gamify some of my projects and experiment.

- I have worked with C, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JS, and currently learning more.
- I love collaborating with others, be it for a hackathon, academic project, or for learning/fun!

Here is my Github link (check my projects out!):
